       "[\"\\n\\n  I have been using smart watches for three year. All of them have been Fitbit. I got bored of them and was looking for a good SMWatch which is when I looked at Samsung Galaxy Active 2 LTE. Been 1 week since I started using it and I should say, this is an amazing piece of art both inside and out. The following are the highlights I noticed1. Beautiful round shaped ergonomically designed body dial with responsive bezel control.2. Cross checked the step count and hear rate with Fitbit. Step count is super accurate. Heart rate varies 1 to 2 bpm which is OK. Very much under tolerance level.3.  Beautiful leather strap. Easy to pin the strap to the leather, if you are coming from Fitbit Versa you know how important this is. Also it doesn't cause any itching. But pls make sure water doesn't stay on it for long time. You may lose it soon4. Auto detection of exercises are super accurate again. Walk and run is auto detected. Yet to check how it treats weights. Waiting for Gyms to reopen5. Battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with heavy usage (kept exploring the watch, 4G is on and sometimes I take call in the watch. No music.) This is way lower than Fitbit. But I will get used to it I believe6. U may get confused on how the trio - Phone, watch and buds - are paired. You will not be able to use ur buds if u attend a call in watch when your phone is nearby. You can use the buds only if you use the standalone watch 4G. Still exploring this area.7. Bit expensive. I will give a 4 star for value for money. Again 4 star because this is probably the best smart watch available in the marketLastly, Amazon's delivery was good. It was delayed by a day. But I understand they are prioritizing the essentials considering that this is a good serviceLet me know if anyone want any specific info and I can help with it.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Waste of money. Worst product i have seen upto now. Don't buy this product. Better go for Apple watch series 5 cellular version. Battery is draining like anything. Without any usage it came to 15%. It is not working with esim. Even samsung customer care also didn't resolved this issue. Jio cc is more worse than samsung cc.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I have always been an Analog watch guy and quite a watch enthusiast. After my recent predicament with the Fitbit Charge 3, I was severely disappointed with their \"No Watch Service\" model.I am a Product Manager in one of the tech companies and a tech - for - all enthusiast.I hope whosoever reads this review finds themselves at the right stage to make a purchase decision.I conducted severe research over the net and concluded two watches:1. Samsung Galaxy Active 22. Apple Watch 5 series--- Apple watch is pretty useless for an android user - hence, that was out the selection parameter. If you are an iPhone user, Apple watch might just be the right thing for you - just note the battery issues there.Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 - I love to track my fitness regime quite strictly with a combination of diet tracking using MyFitnessPal.1. Build Quality - Fantastic build quality and a flamboyant screen this watch has.2. Fitness Tracking - Fitness tracking has never been so extensive with so so many options to track different types of workouts. Heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, stress tracking, water intake tracking and so much more this watch has and all significantly accurate.3. S Health can be installed in any Android device. S Health is absolutely amazing and seamlessly integrates with MyfitnessPal and records exercises.4. Watch Faces - Well, millions of great options for that beautiful screen.5. Battery life - Pretty competitive and descent - far better than Apple watch.Some Cons -1. LTE is sort of useless. In India, only Airtel and JIO support LTE and only if you are looking to receive calls and stuff on your watch (which you can also do via Bluetooth connectivity on the watch), there\\'s no point of buying the LTE version2. App Support - Third-party apps for Samsung watch aren\\'t beautiful looking and most of them are pretty useless. You need to enter into a purchase decision keeping into mind that your watch is a \"WATCH\" and not a smartphone. It will do a lot of great things but will never essentially replace your phone.3. Watch Structure for reading and responding - A circular watch structure is not a very suitable option to read and respond to emails, Whatsapp chats, texts etc. Additionally, the responses are recorded using a query keypad. So if you are looking to do all that with that keypad, well good luck - coz you will be able to send one response in about a month for sure. Trust me - Respond via phone - much simpler. That said, the watch does have a standard set of response texts basis what\\'s written in your text. That can be helpful for sure.Overall - I have decided to give a rating of 4 on 5. Ultimately it does boil down to this - Why do you need a smartwatch? Ask yourself this question and then make a purchase decision.I wish you well!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Revieweing after using it for close to a month.This is a magnificent smart watch. I wanted something that could efficiently track my work outs and also could be a good smart watch. This is has a perfect blend of both. I am happy with my puchase.My watch is connected with my device all the time. With notifications on all the time and GPS tracker for about 2.5 hrs a day, the battery lasts from 30-36 hours which is decent acc to me. It takes about 2-2.5 hours for full charge from zero battery.Its just that you have to manage it as an additional phone device and have to plan when to charge as you would do with your phone.I bought it for 23999.. I could have gone for the e-sim version. I thought it wouldn't be that big a plus but i now regret not going for the esim version. The esim version is a definite positive add on if you can get your hands on it.Speakers on this is very good for such a small device. For cloud based music you have only Spotify.. You can save your songs on your watch (offline mode) if you have Spotify premium. You also have a stock music player. You can save  your songs from your phone on your watch as well. Basic controls of other music app on your phone is possible. You can connect your Bluetooth headset independetly to this watch while your watch is connected to your phone.Trackers are good. Step trackers, cadence are pretty accurate. Heart rate monitors are as good as it can get on a  watch.If you are opting for a smart watch for your outdoor workouts look for a watch that has GPS . This one has and its a plus. There are other paid apps for GPS navigation if you want. I haven't used them so i cant comment. Watch has built in activity tracker. Strava and MapmyRun (Under Armour) app if you want.I have a 44mm watch. Screen size is more than  sufficient. I can comfortably view contents on my screen in broad afternoon sunlight.Watch looks good on your wrist. Neatly made. Looks premium as well . Mine is the aluminium version.The more apps and watch faces you load on your device it tends to hang a bit. Not always but sometimes. The only pain point so far has been the the number of applications as it is very limited. But, these are not deal breakers.Go for it.I hope this helps.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using smart watches for three year. All of them have been Fitbit. I got bored of them and was looking for a good SMWatch which is when I looked at Samsung Galaxy Active 2 LTE. Been 1 week since I started using it and I should say, this is an amazing piece of art both inside and out. The following are the highlights I noticed1. Beautiful round shaped ergonomically designed body dial with responsive bezel control.2. Cross checked the step count and hear rate with Fitbit. Step count is super accurate. Heart rate varies 1 to 2 bpm which is OK. Very much under tolerance level.3.  Beautiful leather strap. Easy to pin the strap to the leather, if you are coming from Fitbit Versa you know how important this is. Also it doesn't cause any itching. But pls make sure water doesn't stay on it for long time. You may lose it soon4. Auto detection of exercises are super accurate again. Walk and run is auto detected. Yet to check how it treats weights. Waiting for Gyms to reopen5. Battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with heavy usage (kept exploring the watch, 4G is on and sometimes I take call in the watch. No music.) This is way lower than Fitbit. But I will get used to it I believe6. U may get confused on how the trio - Phone, watch and buds - are paired. You will not be able to use ur buds if u attend a call in watch when your phone is nearby. You can use the buds only if you use the standalone watch 4G. Still exploring this area.7. Bit expensive. I will give a 4 star for value for money. Again 4 star because this is probably the best smart watch available in the marketLastly, Amazon's delivery was good. It was delayed by a day. But I understand they are prioritizing the essentials considering that this is a good serviceLet me know if anyone want any specific info and I can help with it.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Waste of money. Worst product i have seen upto now. Don't buy this product. Better go for Apple watch series 5 cellular version. Battery is draining like anything. Without any usage it came to 15%. It is not working with esim. Even samsung customer care also didn't resolved this issue. Jio cc is more worse than samsung cc.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I have always been an Analog watch guy and quite a watch enthusiast. After my recent predicament with the Fitbit Charge 3, I was severely disappointed with their \"No Watch Service\" model.I am a Product Manager in one of the tech companies and a tech - for - all enthusiast.I hope whosoever reads this review finds themselves at the right stage to make a purchase decision.I conducted severe research over the net and concluded two watches:1. Samsung Galaxy Active 22. Apple Watch 5 series--- Apple watch is pretty useless for an android user - hence, that was out the selection parameter. If you are an iPhone user, Apple watch might just be the right thing for you - just note the battery issues there.Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 - I love to track my fitness regime quite strictly with a combination of diet tracking using MyFitnessPal.1. Build Quality - Fantastic build quality and a flamboyant screen this watch has.2. Fitness Tracking - Fitness tracking has never been so extensive with so so many options to track different types of workouts. Heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, stress tracking, water intake tracking and so much more this watch has and all significantly accurate.3. S Health can be installed in any Android device. S Health is absolutely amazing and seamlessly integrates with MyfitnessPal and records exercises.4. Watch Faces - Well, millions of great options for that beautiful screen.5. Battery life - Pretty competitive and descent - far better than Apple watch.Some Cons -1. LTE is sort of useless. In India, only Airtel and JIO support LTE and only if you are looking to receive calls and stuff on your watch (which you can also do via Bluetooth connectivity on the watch), there\\'s no point of buying the LTE version2. App Support - Third-party apps for Samsung watch aren\\'t beautiful looking and most of them are pretty useless. You need to enter into a purchase decision keeping into mind that your watch is a \"WATCH\" and not a smartphone. It will do a lot of great things but will never essentially replace your phone.3. Watch Structure for reading and responding - A circular watch structure is not a very suitable option to read and respond to emails, Whatsapp chats, texts etc. Additionally, the responses are recorded using a query keypad. So if you are looking to do all that with that keypad, well good luck - coz you will be able to send one response in about a month for sure. Trust me - Respond via phone - much simpler. That said, the watch does have a standard set of response texts basis what\\'s written in your text. That can be helpful for sure.Overall - I have decided to give a rating of 4 on 5. Ultimately it does boil down to this - Why do you need a smartwatch? Ask yourself this question and then make a purchase decision.I wish you well!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Revieweing after using it for close to a month.This is a magnificent smart watch. I wanted something that could efficiently track my work outs and also could be a good smart watch. This is has a perfect blend of both. I am happy with my puchase.My watch is connected with my device all the time. With notifications on all the time and GPS tracker for about 2.5 hrs a day, the battery lasts from 30-36 hours which is decent acc to me. It takes about 2-2.5 hours for full charge from zero battery.Its just that you have to manage it as an additional phone device and have to plan when to charge as you would do with your phone.I bought it for 23999.. I could have gone for the e-sim version. I thought it wouldn't be that big a plus but i now regret not going for the esim version. The esim version is a definite positive add on if you can get your hands on it.Speakers on this is very good for such a small device. For cloud based music you have only Spotify.. You can save your songs on your watch (offline mode) if you have Spotify premium. You also have a stock music player. You can save  your songs from your phone on your watch as well. Basic controls of other music app on your phone is possible. You can connect your Bluetooth headset independetly to this watch while your watch is connected to your phone.Trackers are good. Step trackers, cadence are pretty accurate. Heart rate monitors are as good as it can get on a  watch.If you are opting for a smart watch for your outdoor workouts look for a watch that has GPS . This one has and its a plus. There are other paid apps for GPS navigation if you want. I haven't used them so i cant comment. Watch has built in activity tracker. Strava and MapmyRun (Under Armour) app if you want.I have a 44mm watch. Screen size is more than  sufficient. I can comfortably view contents on my screen in broad afternoon sunlight.Watch looks good on your wrist. Neatly made. Looks premium as well . Mine is the aluminium version.The more apps and watch faces you load on your device it tends to hang a bit. Not always but sometimes. The only pain point so far has been the the number of applications as it is very limited. But, these are not deal breakers.Go for it.I hope this helps.\\n\\n\",\n",

If you are an iPhone user, Apple watch might just be the right thing for you - just note the battery issues there.Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 - I love to track my fitness regime quite strictly with a combination of diet tracking using MyFitnessPal.1. Build Quality - Fantastic build quality and a flamboyant screen this watch has.2. Fitness Tracking - Fitness tracking has never been so extensive with so so many options to track different types of workouts. Heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, stress tracking, water intake tracking and so much more this watch has and all significantly accurate.3. S Health can be installed in any Android device. S Health is absolutely amazing and seamlessly integrates with MyfitnessPal and records exercises.4. Watch Faces - Well, millions of great options for that beautiful screen.5. Battery life - Pretty competitive and descent - far better than Apple watch.Some Cons -1. LTE is sort of useless. In India, only Airtel and JIO support LTE and only if you are looking to receive calls and stuff on your watch (which you can also do via Bluetooth connectivity on the watch), there\\'s no point of buying the LTE version2. App Support - Third-party apps for Samsung watch aren\\'t beautiful looking and most of them are pretty useless. You need to enter into a purchase decision keeping into mind that your watch is a \"WATCH\" and not a smartphone. It will do a lot of great things but will never essentially replace your phone.3. Watch Structure for reading and responding - A circular watch structure is not a very suitable option to read and respond to emails, Whatsapp chats, texts etc. Additionally, the responses are recorded using a query keypad. So if you are looking to do all that with that keypad, well good luck - coz you will be able to send one response in about a month for sure. Trust me - Respond via phone - much simpler. That said, the watch does have a standard set of response texts basis what\\'s written in your text. That can be helpful for sure.Overall - I have decided to give a rating of 4 on 5. Ultimately it does boil down to this - Why do you need a smartwatch? Ask yourself this question and then make a purchase decision.I wish you well!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Revieweing after using it for close to a month.This is a magnificent smart watch. I wanted something that could efficiently track my work outs and also could be a good smart watch. This is has a perfect blend of both. I am happy with my puchase.My watch is connected with my device all the time. With notifications on all the time and GPS tracker for about 2.5 hrs a day, the battery lasts from 30-36 hours which is decent acc to me. It takes about 2-2.5 hours for full charge from zero battery.Its just that you have to manage it as an additional phone device and have to plan when to charge as you would do with your phone.I bought it for 23999.. I could have gone for the e-sim version. I thought it wouldn't be that big a plus but i now regret not going for the esim version. The esim version is a definite positive add on if you can get your hands on it.Speakers on this is very good for such a small device. For cloud based music you have only Spotify.. You can save your songs on your watch (offline mode) if you have Spotify premium. You also have a stock music player. You can save  your songs from your phone on your watch as well. Basic controls of other music app on your phone is possible. You can connect your Bluetooth headset independetly to this watch while your watch is connected to your phone.Trackers are good. Step trackers, cadence are pretty accurate. Heart rate monitors are as good as it can get on a  watch.If you are opting for a smart watch for your outdoor workouts look for a watch that has GPS . This one has and its a plus. There are other paid apps for GPS navigation if you want. I haven't used them so i cant comment. Watch has built in activity tracker. Strava and MapmyRun (Under Armour) app if you want.I have a 44mm watch. Screen size is more than  sufficient. I can comfortably view contents on my screen in broad afternoon sunlight.Watch looks good on your wrist. Neatly made. Looks premium as well . Mine is the aluminium version.The more apps and watch faces you load on your device it tends to hang a bit. Not always but sometimes. The only pain point so far has been the the number of applications as it is very limited. But, these are not deal breakers.Go for it.I hope this helps.\\n\\n\",\n",

Remember this happens just during setup and few hours after....even further u can contact samsung customer care.Custom watch faces are neat and decent and premium watch faces can be bought on galaxy store which are worth it but they should reduce the cost although everything is below 200₹.

       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using smart watches for three year. All of them have been Fitbit. I got bored of them and was looking for a good SMWatch which is when I looked at Samsung Galaxy Active 2 LTE. Been 1 week since I started using it and I should say, this is an amazing piece of art both inside and out. The following are the highlights I noticed1. Beautiful round shaped ergonomically designed body dial with responsive bezel control.2. Cross checked the step count and hear rate with Fitbit. Step count is super accurate. Heart rate varies 1 to 2 bpm which is OK. Very much under tolerance level.3.  Beautiful leather strap. Easy to pin the strap to the leather, if you are coming from Fitbit Versa you know how important this is. Also it doesn't cause any itching. But pls make sure water doesn't stay on it for long time. You may lose it soon4. Auto detection of exercises are super accurate again. Walk and run is auto detected. Yet to check how it treats weights. Waiting for Gyms to reopen5. Battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with heavy usage (kept exploring the watch, 4G is on and sometimes I take call in the watch. No music.) This is way lower than Fitbit. But I will get used to it I believe6. U may get confused on how the trio - Phone, watch and buds - are paired. You will not be able to use ur buds if u attend a call in watch when your phone is nearby. You can use the buds only if you use the standalone watch 4G. Still exploring this area.7. Bit expensive. I will give a 4 star for value for money. Again 4 star because this is probably the best smart watch available in the marketLastly, Amazon's delivery was good. It was delayed by a day.

       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using smart watches for three year. All of them have been Fitbit. I got bored of them and was looking for a good SMWatch which is when I looked at Samsung Galaxy Active 2 LTE. Been 1 week since I started using it and I should say, this is an amazing piece of art both inside and out. The following are the highlights I noticed1. Beautiful round shaped ergonomically designed body dial with responsive bezel control.2. Cross checked the step count and hear rate with Fitbit. Step count is super accurate. Heart rate varies 1 to 2 bpm which is OK. Very much under tolerance level.3.  Beautiful leather strap. Easy to pin the strap to the leather, if you are coming from Fitbit Versa you know how important this is. Also it doesn't cause any itching. But pls make sure water doesn't stay on it for long time. You may lose it soon4. Auto detection of exercises are super accurate again. Walk and run is auto detected. Yet to check how it treats weights. Waiting for Gyms to reopen5. Battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with heavy usage (kept exploring the watch, 4G is on and sometimes I take call in the watch. No music.) This is way lower than Fitbit. But I will get used to it I believe6. U may get confused on how the trio - Phone, watch and buds - are paired. You will not be able to use ur buds if u attend a call in watch when your phone is nearby. You can use the buds only if you use the standalone watch 4G. Still exploring this area.7. Bit expensive. I will give a 4 star for value for money. Again 4 star because this is probably the best smart watch available in the marketLastly, Amazon's delivery was good. It was delayed by a day. But I understand they are prioritizing the essentials considering that this is a good serviceLet me know if anyone want any specific info and I can help with it.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I have always been an Analog watch guy and quite a watch enthusiast. After my recent predicament with the Fitbit Charge 3, I was severely disappointed with their \"No Watch Service\" model.I am a Product Manager in one of the tech companies and a tech - for - all enthusiast.I hope whosoever reads this review finds themselves at the right stage to make a purchase decision.I conducted severe research over the net and concluded two watches:1. Samsung Galaxy Active 22. Apple Watch 5 series--- Apple watch is pretty useless for an android user - hence, that was out the selection parameter. If you are an iPhone user, Apple watch might just be the right thing for you - just note the battery issues there.Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 - I love to track my fitness regime quite strictly with a combination of diet tracking using MyFitnessPal.1. Build Quality - Fantastic build quality and a flamboyant screen this watch has.2. Fitness Tracking - Fitness tracking has never been so extensive with so so many options to track different types of workouts. Heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, stress tracking, water intake tracking and so much more this watch has and all significantly accurate.3. S Health can be installed in any Android device. S Health is absolutely amazing and seamlessly integrates with MyfitnessPal and records exercises.4. Watch Faces - Well, millions of great options for that beautiful screen.5. Battery life - Pretty competitive and descent - far better than Apple watch.Some Cons -1. LTE is sort of useless. In India, only Airtel and JIO support LTE and only if you are looking to receive calls and stuff on your watch (which you can also do via Bluetooth connectivity on the watch), there\\'s no point of buying the LTE version2. App Support - Third-party apps for Samsung watch aren\\'t beautiful looking and most of them are pretty useless. You need to enter into a purchase decision keeping into mind that your watch is a \"WATCH\" and not a smartphone. It will do a lot of great things but will never essentially replace your phone.3. Watch Structure for reading and responding - A circular watch structure is not a very suitable option to read and respond to emails, Whatsapp chats, texts etc. Additionally, the responses are recorded using a query keypad. So if you are looking to do all that with that keypad, well good luck - coz you will be able to send one response in about a month for sure. Trust me - Respond via phone - much simpler. That said, the watch does have a standard set of response texts basis what\\'s written in your text. That can be helpful for sure.Overall - I have decided to give a rating of 4 on 5. Ultimately it does boil down to this - Why do you need a smartwatch? Ask yourself this question and then make a purchase decision.I wish you well!\\n\\n',\n",

There are very wide free option u can download but the premium are u know more premium ☺️.Overall a very good smart watch and I am happy with it and dominates Apple watch at battery and Android and iOS compatability as Apple watch cannot be used with Android OS😑.This watch does have ECG hardware equipped but not functional yet, this will be added late 2020 to watch through software update they say.I am using LTE version , and there is huge diff btw lte and non lte .Lte can be used independently without phone , via sim services but india rn JIO AND AIRTEL ONLY PROVIDE THIS FEATURE.

       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using smart watches for three year. All of them have been Fitbit. I got bored of them and was looking for a good SMWatch which is when I looked at Samsung Galaxy Active 2 LTE. Been 1 week since I started using it and I should say, this is an amazing piece of art both inside and out. The following are the highlights I noticed1. Beautiful round shaped ergonomically designed body dial with responsive bezel control.2. Cross checked the step count and hear rate with Fitbit. Step count is super accurate. Heart rate varies 1 to 2 bpm which is OK. Very much under tolerance level.3.  Beautiful leather strap. Easy to pin the strap to the leather, if you are coming from Fitbit Versa you know how important this is. Also it doesn't cause any itching. But pls make sure water doesn't stay on it for long time. You may lose it soon4. Auto detection of exercises are super accurate again. Walk and run is auto detected. Yet to check how it treats weights. Waiting for Gyms to reopen5. Battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with heavy usage (kept exploring the watch, 4G is on and sometimes I take call in the watch. No music.) This is way lower than Fitbit. But I will get used to it I believe6. U may get confused on how the trio - Phone, watch and buds - are paired. You will not be able to use ur buds if u attend a call in watch when your phone is nearby. You can use the buds only if you use the standalone watch 4G. Still exploring this area.7. Bit expensive. I will give a 4 star for value for money. Again 4 star because this is probably the best smart watch available in the marketLastly, Amazon's delivery was good. It was delayed by a day. But I understand they are prioritizing the essentials considering that this is a good serviceLet me know if anyone want any specific info and I can help with it.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n  I have always been an Analog watch guy and quite a watch enthusiast. After my recent predicament with the Fitbit Charge 3, I was severely disappointed with their \"No Watch Service\" model.I am a Product Manager in one of the tech companies and a tech - for - all enthusiast.I hope whosoever reads this review finds themselves at the right stage to make a purchase decision.I conducted severe research over the net and concluded two watches:1. Samsung Galaxy Active 22. Apple Watch 5 series--- Apple watch is pretty useless for an android user - hence, that was out the selection parameter. If you are an iPhone user, Apple watch might just be the right thing for you - just note the battery issues there.Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 - I love to track my fitness regime quite strictly with a combination of diet tracking using MyFitnessPal.1. Build Quality - Fantastic build quality and a flamboyant screen this watch has.2. Fitness Tracking - Fitness tracking has never been so extensive with so so many options to track different types of workouts. Heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, stress tracking, water intake tracking and so much more this watch has and all significantly accurate.3. S Health can be installed in any Android device. S Health is absolutely amazing and seamlessly integrates with MyfitnessPal and records exercises.4. Watch Faces - Well, millions of great options for that beautiful screen.5. Battery life - Pretty competitive and descent - far better than Apple watch.Some Cons -1. LTE is sort of useless. In India, only Airtel and JIO support LTE and only if you are looking to receive calls and stuff on your watch (which you can also do via Bluetooth connectivity on the watch), there\\'s no point of buying the LTE version2. App Support - Third-party apps for Samsung watch aren\\'t beautiful looking and most of them are pretty useless. You need to enter into a purchase decision keeping into mind that your watch is a \"WATCH\" and not a smartphone. It will do a lot of great things but will never essentially replace your phone.3. Watch Structure for reading and responding - A circular watch structure is not a very suitable option to read and respond to emails, Whatsapp chats, texts etc. Additionally, the responses are recorded using a query keypad. So if you are looking to do all that with that keypad, well good luck - coz you will be able to send one response in about a month for sure. Trust me - Respond via phone - much simpler. That said, the watch does have a standard set of response texts basis what\\'s written in your text. That can be helpful for sure.Overall - I have decided to give a rating of 4 on 5. Ultimately it does boil down to this - Why do you need a smartwatch? Ask yourself this question and then make a purchase decision.I wish you well!\\n\\n',\n",

With notifications on all the time and GPS tracker for about 2.5 hrs a day, the battery lasts from 30-36 hours which is decent acc to me. It takes about 2-2.5 hours for full charge from zero battery.Its just that you have to manage it as an additional phone device and have to plan when to charge as you would do with your phone.I bought it for 23999.. I could have gone for the e-sim version. I thought it wouldn't be that big a plus but i now regret not going for the esim version. The esim version is a definite positive add on if you can get your hands on it.Speakers on this is very good for such a small device. For cloud based music you have only Spotify.. You can save your songs on your watch (offline mode) if you have Spotify premium. You also have a stock music player. You can save  your songs from your phone on your watch as well.

       " '\\n\\n  I have always been an Analog watch guy and quite a watch enthusiast. After my recent predicament with the Fitbit Charge 3, I was severely disappointed with their \"No Watch Service\" model.I am a Product Manager in one of the tech companies and a tech - for - all enthusiast.I hope whosoever reads this review finds themselves at the right stage to make a purchase decision.I conducted severe research over the net and concluded two watches:1. Samsung Galaxy Active 22. Apple Watch 5 series--- Apple watch is pretty useless for an android user - hence, that was out the selection parameter. If you are an iPhone user, Apple watch might just be the right thing for you - just note the battery issues there.Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 - I love to track my fitness regime quite strictly with a combination of diet tracking using MyFitnessPal.1. Build Quality - Fantastic build quality and a flamboyant screen this watch has.2. Fitness Tracking - Fitness tracking has never been so extensive with so so many options to track different types of workouts. Heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, stress tracking, water intake tracking and so much more this watch has and all significantly accurate.3. S Health can be installed in any Android device. S Health is absolutely amazing and seamlessly integrates with MyfitnessPal and records exercises.4. Watch Faces - Well, millions of great options for that beautiful screen.5. Battery life - Pretty competitive and descent - far better than Apple watch.Some Cons -1. LTE is sort of useless. In India, only Airtel and JIO support LTE and only if you are looking to receive calls and stuff on your watch (which you can also do via Bluetooth connectivity on the watch), there\\'s no point of buying the LTE version2. App Support - Third-party apps for Samsung watch aren\\'t beautiful looking and most of them are pretty useless. You need to enter into a purchase decision keeping into mind that your watch is a \"WATCH\" and not a smartphone. It will do a lot of great things but will never essentially replace your phone.3. Watch Structure for reading and responding - A circular watch structure is not a very suitable option to read and respond to emails, Whatsapp chats, texts etc. Additionally, the responses are recorded using a query keypad. So if you are looking to do all that with that keypad, well good luck - coz you will be able to send one response in about a month for sure. Trust me - Respond via phone - much simpler. That said, the watch does have a standard set of response texts basis what\\'s written in your text. That can be helpful for sure.Overall - I have decided to give a rating of 4 on 5. Ultimately it does boil down to this - Why do you need a smartwatch? Ask yourself this question and then make a purchase decision.I wish you well!\\n\\n',\n",

With notifications on all the time and GPS tracker for about 2.5 hrs a day, the battery lasts from 30-36 hours which is decent acc to me. It takes about 2-2.5 hours for full charge from zero battery.Its just that you have to manage it as an additional phone device and have to plan when to charge as you would do with your phone.I bought it for 23999.. I could have gone for the e-sim version. I thought it wouldn't be that big a plus but i now regret not going for the esim version. The esim version is a definite positive add on if you can get your hands on it.Speakers on this is very good for such a small device. For cloud based music you have only Spotify.. You can save your songs on your watch (offline mode) if you have Spotify premium. You also have a stock music player. You can save  your songs from your phone on your watch as well. Basic controls of other music app on your phone is possible. You can connect your Bluetooth headset independetly to this watch while your watch is connected to your phone.Trackers are good. Step trackers, cadence are pretty accurate. Heart rate monitors are as good as it can get on a  watch.If you are opting for a smart watch for your outdoor workouts look for a watch that has GPS .

So if you are looking to do all that with that keypad, well good luck - coz you will be able to send one response in about a month for sure. Trust me - Respond via phone - much simpler. That said, the watch does have a standard set of response texts basis what\\'s written in your text. That can be helpful for sure.Overall - I have decided to give a rating of 4 on 5. Ultimately it does boil down to this - Why do you need a smartwatch? Ask yourself this question and then make a purchase decision.I wish you well!\\n\\n',\n",

With notifications on all the time and GPS tracker for about 2.5 hrs a day, the battery lasts from 30-36 hours which is decent acc to me. It takes about 2-2.5 hours for full charge from zero battery.Its just that you have to manage it as an additional phone device and have to plan when to charge as you would do with your phone.I bought it for 23999.. I could have gone for the e-sim version. I thought it wouldn't be that big a plus but i now regret not going for the esim version. The esim version is a definite positive add on if you can get your hands on it.Speakers on this is very good for such a small device. For cloud based music you have only Spotify.. You can save your songs on your watch (offline mode) if you have Spotify premium. You also have a stock music player. You can save  your songs from your phone on your watch as well. Basic controls of other music app on your phone is possible. You can connect your Bluetooth headset independetly to this watch while your watch is connected to your phone.Trackers are good. Step trackers, cadence are pretty accurate. Heart rate monitors are as good as it can get on a  watch.If you are opting for a smart watch for your outdoor workouts look for a watch that has GPS .

       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using smart watches for three year. All of them have been Fitbit. I got bored of them and was looking for a good SMWatch which is when I looked at Samsung Galaxy Active 2 LTE. Been 1 week since I started using it and I should say, this is an amazing piece of art both inside and out. The following are the highlights I noticed1. Beautiful round shaped ergonomically designed body dial with responsive bezel control.2. Cross checked the step count and hear rate with Fitbit. Step count is super accurate. Heart rate varies 1 to 2 bpm which is OK. Very much under tolerance level.3.  Beautiful leather strap. Easy to pin the strap to the leather, if you are coming from Fitbit Versa you know how important this is. Also it doesn't cause any itching. But pls make sure water doesn't stay on it for long time. You may lose it soon4. Auto detection of exercises are super accurate again. Walk and run is auto detected. Yet to check how it treats weights. Waiting for Gyms to reopen5. Battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with heavy usage (kept exploring the watch, 4G is on and sometimes I take call in the watch. No music.) This is way lower than Fitbit. But I will get used to it I believe6. U may get confused on how the trio - Phone, watch and buds - are paired. You will not be able to use ur buds if u attend a call in watch when your phone is nearby. You can use the buds only if you use the standalone watch 4G. Still exploring this area.7. Bit expensive. I will give a 4 star for value for money. Again 4 star because this is probably the best smart watch available in the marketLastly, Amazon's delivery was good. It was delayed by a day. But I understand they are prioritizing the essentials considering that this is a good serviceLet me know if anyone want any specific info and I can help with it.\\n\\n\",\n",

Samsung Galaxy Active 22. Apple Watch 5 series--- Apple watch is pretty useless for an android user - hence, that was out the selection parameter. If you are an iPhone user, Apple watch might just be the right thing for you - just note the battery issues there.Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 - I love to track my fitness regime quite strictly with a combination of diet tracking using MyFitnessPal.1. Build Quality - Fantastic build quality and a flamboyant screen this watch has.2. Fitness Tracking - Fitness tracking has never been so extensive with so so many options to track different types of workouts. Heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, stress tracking, water intake tracking and so much more this watch has and all significantly accurate.3. S Health can be installed in any Android device. S Health is absolutely amazing and seamlessly integrates with MyfitnessPal and records exercises.4. Watch Faces - Well, millions of great options for that beautiful screen.5. Battery life - Pretty competitive and descent - far better than Apple watch.Some Cons -1. LTE is sort of useless. In India, only Airtel and JIO support LTE and only if you are looking to receive calls and stuff on your watch (which you can also do via Bluetooth connectivity on the watch), there\\'s no point of buying the LTE version2.

Remember this happens just during setup and few hours after....even further u can contact samsung customer care.Custom watch faces are neat and decent and premium watch faces can be bought on galaxy store which are worth it but they should reduce the cost although everything is below 200₹.

       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using smart watches for three year. All of them have been Fitbit. I got bored of them and was looking for a good SMWatch which is when I looked at Samsung Galaxy Active 2 LTE. Been 1 week since I started using it and I should say, this is an amazing piece of art both inside and out. The following are the highlights I noticed1. Beautiful round shaped ergonomically designed body dial with responsive bezel control.2. Cross checked the step count and hear rate with Fitbit. Step count is super accurate. Heart rate varies 1 to 2 bpm which is OK. Very much under tolerance level.3.  Beautiful leather strap. Easy to pin the strap to the leather, if you are coming from Fitbit Versa you know how important this is. Also it doesn't cause any itching. But pls make sure water doesn't stay on it for long time. You may lose it soon4. Auto detection of exercises are super accurate again. Walk and run is auto detected. Yet to check how it treats weights. Waiting for Gyms to reopen5. Battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with heavy usage (kept exploring the watch, 4G is on and sometimes I take call in the watch. No music.) This is way lower than Fitbit. But I will get used to it I believe6. U may get confused on how the trio - Phone, watch and buds - are paired. You will not be able to use ur buds if u attend a call in watch when your phone is nearby. You can use the buds only if you use the standalone watch 4G. Still exploring this area.7. Bit expensive. I will give a 4 star for value for money. Again 4 star because this is probably the best smart watch available in the marketLastly, Amazon's delivery was good. It was delayed by a day. But I understand they are prioritizing the essentials considering that this is a good serviceLet me know if anyone want any specific info and I can help with it.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Waste of money. Worst product i have seen upto now. Don't buy this product. Better go for Apple watch series 5 cellular version. Battery is draining like anything. Without any usage it came to 15%. It is not working with esim. Even samsung customer care also didn't resolved this issue. Jio cc is more worse than samsung cc.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I have always been an Analog watch guy and quite a watch enthusiast. After my recent predicament with the Fitbit Charge 3, I was severely disappointed with their \"No Watch Service\" model.I am a Product Manager in one of the tech companies and a tech - for - all enthusiast.I hope whosoever reads this review finds themselves at the right stage to make a purchase decision.I conducted severe research over the net and concluded two watches:1. Samsung Galaxy Active 22. Apple Watch 5 series--- Apple watch is pretty useless for an android user - hence, that was out the selection parameter. If you are an iPhone user, Apple watch might just be the right thing for you - just note the battery issues there.Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 - I love to track my fitness regime quite strictly with a combination of diet tracking using MyFitnessPal.1. Build Quality - Fantastic build quality and a flamboyant screen this watch has.2. Fitness Tracking - Fitness tracking has never been so extensive with so so many options to track different types of workouts. Heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, stress tracking, water intake tracking and so much more this watch has and all significantly accurate.3. S Health can be installed in any Android device. S Health is absolutely amazing and seamlessly integrates with MyfitnessPal and records exercises.4. Watch Faces - Well, millions of great options for that beautiful screen.5. Battery life - Pretty competitive and descent - far better than Apple watch.Some Cons -1. LTE is sort of useless. In India, only Airtel and JIO support LTE and only if you are looking to receive calls and stuff on your watch (which you can also do via Bluetooth connectivity on the watch), there\\'s no point of buying the LTE version2. App Support - Third-party apps for Samsung watch aren\\'t beautiful looking and most of them are pretty useless. You need to enter into a purchase decision keeping into mind that your watch is a \"WATCH\" and not a smartphone. It will do a lot of great things but will never essentially replace your phone.3. Watch Structure for reading and responding - A circular watch structure is not a very suitable option to read and respond to emails, Whatsapp chats, texts etc. Additionally, the responses are recorded using a query keypad. So if you are looking to do all that with that keypad, well good luck - coz you will be able to send one response in about a month for sure. Trust me - Respond via phone - much simpler. That said, the watch does have a standard set of response texts basis what\\'s written in your text. That can be helpful for sure.Overall - I have decided to give a rating of 4 on 5. Ultimately it does boil down to this - Why do you need a smartwatch? Ask yourself this question and then make a purchase decision.I wish you well!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Revieweing after using it for close to a month.This is a magnificent smart watch. I wanted something that could efficiently track my work outs and also could be a good smart watch. This is has a perfect blend of both. I am happy with my puchase.My watch is connected with my device all the time. With notifications on all the time and GPS tracker for about 2.5 hrs a day, the battery lasts from 30-36 hours which is decent acc to me. It takes about 2-2.5 hours for full charge from zero battery.Its just that you have to manage it as an additional phone device and have to plan when to charge as you would do with your phone.I bought it for 23999.. I could have gone for the e-sim version. I thought it wouldn't be that big a plus but i now regret not going for the esim version. The esim version is a definite positive add on if you can get your hands on it.Speakers on this is very good for such a small device. For cloud based music you have only Spotify.. You can save your songs on your watch (offline mode) if you have Spotify premium. You also have a stock music player. You can save  your songs from your phone on your watch as well. Basic controls of other music app on your phone is possible. You can connect your Bluetooth headset independetly to this watch while your watch is connected to your phone.Trackers are good. Step trackers, cadence are pretty accurate. Heart rate monitors are as good as it can get on a  watch.If you are opting for a smart watch for your outdoor workouts look for a watch that has GPS . This one has and its a plus. There are other paid apps for GPS navigation if you want. I haven't used them so i cant comment. Watch has built in activity tracker. Strava and MapmyRun (Under Armour) app if you want.I have a 44mm watch. Screen size is more than  sufficient.
